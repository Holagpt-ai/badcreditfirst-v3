# Issuer Routing Logic
# Human-readable logic for dev sanity. Machine-enforced via lib/hybrid-seo-rules.ts

IF credit_score < 500:
  show secured + guaranteed approval issuers only

IF credit_score 500–579:
  hybrid secured/unsecured

IF credit_score >= 580:
  entry unsecured

IF mobile:
  suppress secondary monetization until scroll > 60%

IF EPC < floor:
  remove issuer immediately

IF approval rate drops:
  throttle issuer before network flags
